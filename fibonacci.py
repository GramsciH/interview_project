# The Fibonacci sequence is devined as follows: the firts number of the sequence is 0,
# the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers.
# Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
# ex. -> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..
# Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
